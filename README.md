Note: package.json

css-compile-bash was altered where: node-sass  &  replaced with sass-embedded.  This is just for reference to set up a css compiler.  This option does not work

Same With js-minify:  where adminlte was got changed to the name of this project.

postinstall: is part of npm install lifecycle so it's been depreciated in this project. The example is for publishing to npm registry.
